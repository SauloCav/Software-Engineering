### 01. Describe three benefits of the design property called information hiding?

### 02. Suppose a programmer adopts the following strategy: when implementing any new functionality or correcting a bug that implies modifying two classes A and B located in different files, he completes the task by moving the classes to the same file. Explaining better: after finishing the programming task that was under his responsibility, he chooses one of the classes, let's say class B, and moves it to the same file as class A. Acting this way, he will be improving which design property? On the other hand, which design property is being negatively affected? Justify.

### 03. Classitis is the name given by John Ousterhout to the proliferation of small classes in a system. According to him, classitis can result in classes that are individually simple, but that increase the total complexity of a system. Using the concepts of coupling and cohesion, how can we explain the problem caused by this disease?

### 04. Define: (a) acceptable coupling; (b) poor coupling; (c) structural coupling; (d) evolutionary (or logical) coupling.

### 05. Give an example of: (1) structural and acceptable coupling; (2) structural and poor coupling.

### 06. Is it possible for a class A to be coupled to a class B without having a reference to B in your code? If so, is this coupling acceptable or is it a bad coupling?

### 07. Suppose a program where all the code is implemented in the main method. Does he have a cohesion or coupling problem? Justify.
