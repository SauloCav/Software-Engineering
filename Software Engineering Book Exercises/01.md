### 01: According to Frederick Brooks, software development faces essential difficulties (for which there is no silver bullet) and accidental difficulties (for which there is a better solution). Give an example of an accidental difficulty you have experienced when developing programs, even small ones. Hint: These could be related to tools you've used, such as compilers, IDEs, databases, operating systems, etc.


### 02: Differentiate functional requirements from non-functional requirements.


### 03: Explain why testing can be considered both a software verification and validation activity. Which type of test is best suited if the objective is verification? Which type of testing is most appropriate if the objective is to validate a software system?


### 04: Why tests fail to prove the absence of bugs?


### 05: Suppose a program has a single input: a 64-bit integer. In an exhaustive test, we have to test this program with all possible integers (thus, 264). If each test takes 1 nanosecond (10-9 seconds), how long will this exhaustive test take?


### 06: If we consider the historical context, why was it natural for the first software development processes to have sequential characteristics and be based on detailed planning and documentation?


### 07: Some studies show that maintenance and evolution costs can reach 80% or more of the total costs allocated to a software system, throughout its life cycle. Explain why this value is so high.
