### 01 [POSCOMP 2010, adapted] Under Requirements Engineering, check True (T) or False (F).
#### ( ) Requirements Engineering, like all other Software Engineering activities, needs to be adapted to the needs of the process, the project, the product and the people doing the work.
#### ( ) In the requirements gathering and analysis stage, members of the technical software development team work with the customer and end users of the system to find out more information about the application domain, what services the system should provide, the required performance of the system, the restrictions of hardware, among other information.
#### ( ) As information from various points of view is collected, the emerging requirements are consistent.
#### ( ) Requirements validation is concerned with showing that they really define the system that the customer wants. It is important because errors occurring in a requirements document can lead to large costs related to rework.

### 02 Name at least five requirements elicitation techniques.

### 03 What are the three parts of a user story? Please respond using the 3C's acronym.

### 04 Assume a social network like Facebook. (1) Write a set of five stories for this network, assuming the role of a typical user; (2) Now think of one more user role and write at least two stories for it.

### 05 In Software Engineering, anti-patterns are not recommended solutions for a certain problem. Write at least five anti-patterns for user stories. In other words, describe story formats that are not recommended or that do not have recommended properties.

### 06 Think of a system and write an epic story for it.

### 07 In the context of requirements, what does the expression gold plating mean?

### 08 Write a use case for a Library Control System (similar to the one we used to illustrate story writing in Section 3.3.1).

### 09 The following use case has just the normal flow. Then write some extensions for it.

10. For each requirements specification and/or validation technique below, describe a system in which its use would be most recommended: (1) User Stories; (2) Use Cases; (3) MVPs.

11. What is the difference between a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and the product obtained in the first iteration of an agile method such as XP or Scrum?

12. The article Failures to be celebrated: an analysis of major pivots of software startups (link) presents a discussion of almost 50 real cases of pivots in software startups. In Section 2.3, the article presents a classification of ten pivot types common in these startups. Read this part of the article, list at least five types of pivots and briefly describe each one.

13. When it started, EasyTaxi — the Brazilian taxi ordering app company — built an MVP that used very simple software and an operational part performed manually. Search the Internet for this MVP (just use the words EasyTaxi and MVP) and write a description of it.
