### 01 How does XP recommend that software development contracts should be?

### 02 What are the differences between XP and Scrum?

### 04 In Scrum, what is the difference between the top and bottom stories of the Product Backlog?

### 05 What are story points and what are they for?

### 06 In Scrum, what is the difference between a sprint review and a retrospective?

### 07 Can a sprint be cancelled? If yes, by whom and for what reason? To answer this question, first consult the Scrum Guide (link), which is the guide that documents the official version of Scrum.

### 08 Try to think of a system in an area you have some knowledge of. (a) Then write a story for this system (note that stories are short feature specifications, 2-3 sentences long). (b) Next, break the story you defined into a few tasks (similar to what we did on the Stack Overflow-like system used as an example in the XP section). (c) Are there dependencies between these tasks? Or can they be implemented in any order?

### 09 Suppose two teams, A and B, working on different projects, hired by different companies, with no connections between them. However, both teams adopt 15-day sprints and both have 5 developers. In their projects, team A considers that its velocity is 24 points. Team B assumes a speed of 16 points. Can you say that A is 50% more productive than B? Justify your answer.
