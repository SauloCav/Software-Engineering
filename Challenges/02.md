# D2 - REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING CHALLENGE
Prof. Allysson Allex Ara√∫jo

## The challenge is to create a requirements specification for a software system based on the email below.
"Dear:
We are a small healthcare company and we need to develop a system that will help us manage our patients.
The system must allow our doctors and nurses to record information about patients, including their personal information, medical history, tests performed, treatments and prescriptions.
We also need an intuitive and user-friendly user interface that allows our patients to access the system to book appointments, check their test results, contact information, office hours and other health-related information.
Finally, we would like the system to be able to send email or SMS reminders to patients to remind them of their medical appointments.
Thanks for your help!
Sincerely,
The XYZ Clinic team"
