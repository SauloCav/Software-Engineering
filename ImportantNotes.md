# Software Engineering

## Fundamentals
- Critical factors for software failures:
▹ Increased demand: the techniques help us to build larger and more complex systems, demands change;
▹ Low expectations: It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using techniques and methods of software engineering. We need education and training.
- Software engineering involves sociotechnical activities which aim to support professional software development (hard skills and soft skills), rather than individual programming.
- SOFTWARE: This is not just the program itself, but all associated documentation and configuration data needed to make this program operate correctly.
- Essential attributes of good software: maintainability; trust and protection; efficiency and acceptability.
- ES emerged in the context of the so-called Software Crisis during the 70s.
▹ Term coined by Margareth Hamilton;
▹ Meeting at a conference organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1968;
▹ High costs, delays in delivery, low reliability, high unmet demand, difficult maintenance, etc;
▹ Too much emphasis on programming than principles and best practices;
▹ Lack of a system in the development process.
- Software process is a sequence of activities leading to the production of a software product.
- The ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently is the goal of every engineer.
