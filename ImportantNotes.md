# Software Engineering

## Fundamentals
- Critical factors for software failures: <br>
▹ Increased demand: the techniques help us to build larger and more complex systems, demands change; <br>
▹ Low expectations: It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using techniques and methods of software engineering. We need education and training.
- Software engineering involves sociotechnical activities which aim to support professional software development (hard skills and soft skills), rather than individual programming.
- SOFTWARE: This is not just the program itself, but all associated documentation and configuration data needed to make this program operate correctly.
- Essential attributes of good software: maintainability; trust and protection; efficiency and acceptability.
- ES emerged in the context of the so-called Software Crisis during the 70s. <br>
▹ Term coined by Margareth Hamilton; <br>
▹ Meeting at a conference organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1968; <br>
▹ High costs, delays in delivery, low reliability, high unmet demand, difficult maintenance, etc; <br>
▹ Too much emphasis on programming than principles and best practices; <br>
▹ Lack of a system in the development process.
- Software process is a sequence of activities leading to the production of a software product.
- The ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently is the goal of every engineer.


## Software Processes
- A traditional engineering process consists of a set of interrelated activities that transform one or more inputs into outputs while consuming resources to perform the transformation.
- A software process is a set of related activities that lead to the production of a software product.
- Software processes are specified for a number of reasons: <br>
▹ To facilitate human understanding, communication and coordination; <br>
▹ Assist in the management of software projects; <br>
▹ Measure and improve the quality of software products efficiently; <br>
▹ Support process improvement; <br>
▹ Provide a foundation for automated process execution support.
### Cascade model
- Proposed in the 70's and inspired by traditional engineering processes.
- Design with two features: <br>
▹ Detailed planning (big upfront design); <br>
▹ Activities sequentially in different phases.
- In principle, the result of each stage is the approval of one or more documents. The next stage should not be started until the previous stage is completed.
- Benefits:
1) Easy to understand, easy to use
2) Provide structure for inexperienced employees
3) Milestones are well understood
4) Defines the stability of the requirements
5) Good for management control (plan, team, follow-up)
6) Works well when quality is more important than cost or schedule.
- Difficulties
1) Customers don't know what they want (in a software).
2) It is no longer possible to spend “1 year” gathering requirements, 1 year designing, 1 year implementing, etc.
3) Excessively detailed documentation.
### Incremental model
- This approach merges requirements activities (plan driven or agile), construction and testing. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous one.
- Benefits:
1) The cost of accommodating changes in customer requirements is reduced;
2) It's easier to get feedback from customers about the development that was done;
3) It is possible to achieve rapid delivery and implementation of useful customer software, even if all functionality is not included.
- Problems:
1) The process is not as visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure progress;
2) The structure of the system tends to degrade with the addition of new increments.
### Boehm's spiral model
- Proposed by Barry Boehm in 1986, the spiral model is an example of an evolutionary software process model that couples the iterative nature of prototyping with the controlled and systematic aspects of the waterfall model.
- As software evolves cyclically as the process progresses, the developer and customer better understand and react to risks at each evolutionary level while risk is reduced.
- Each lap is divided into four sectors:
1) Definition of objectives: objectives, constraints and risks are identified. A management plan is developed;
2) Risk assessment and reduction: an analysis of the identified risks is carried out and measures are taken to reduce them;
3) Development and validation: the most appropriate development model is decided.
4) Planning: the project is reviewed and a decision is made about the continuity of the model in a new turn of the spiral.
- Advantages:
1) Provides an early indication of insurmountable risks without much cost;
2) Changes are accommodated;
3) The development phases can be determined by the project manager, according to the complexity of the project;
4) Users can be closely linked to all stages of the lifecycle and can see the system early because of rapid prototyping tools.
- Difficulties:
1) Time spent on very substantial risk assessment for small or low-risk projects;
2) The time spent planning, redefining objectives, doing risk analysis and prototyping can be excessive;
3) The model is complex;
4) Experience in risk assessment is required.
